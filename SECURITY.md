# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

ClaimBound Public Benchmarks is currently pre-1.0 public research tooling. Security fixes are applied to the default branch and to the latest tagged release when practical.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest `main` | Yes |
| Latest tagged release | Yes |
| Older releases | No, unless a severe issue affects public users |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories:

<https://github.com/NeoZorK/claimbound-public-benchmarks/security/advisories/new>

Do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities involving:

- dependency compromise;
- CI or GitHub Actions permissions;
- repository publication guard bypasses;
- accidental exposure of raw payloads, local paths, credentials, tokens, or private-source material;
- unsafe handling of operator-supplied files.

## Expected Response

I aim to acknowledge valid reports within 7 calendar days. If the report is accepted, I will try to provide a fix, mitigation, or documented decision within 30 calendar days, depending on severity and available maintainer time.

If the report is declined, I will explain the reason where possible.

## Project-Specific Boundaries

This repository is public ClaimBound benchmark foreground. It must not contain raw external payloads, credentials, private local paths, Closed Core source code, or private production integrations.

Security reports about private systems, Closed Core implementations, or unrelated infrastructure are out of scope for this public repository unless they demonstrate a direct leak or vulnerability in the public benchmark code.

## Safe Handling Notes

When reproducing benchmarks:

- keep raw payloads outside the repository;
- publish hashes, manifests, summaries, and claim boundaries only;
- do not include access tokens, cookies, API keys, or private local paths in reports;
- verify generated artifacts before committing.
