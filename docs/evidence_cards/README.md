# Evidence Cards

Evidence cards are the public share unit for ClaimBound results.

Each card is a compact JSON record that points to:

- the frozen protocol;
- the public source boundary;
- the sanitized result artifact;
- the exact result status;
- the claim boundary;
- the reproduction level.

The card is designed to be copied as a URL, attached to a discussion, or listed
in a public registry. It is not a certificate and does not imply approval
outside the documented protocol.

## Current Examples

| Card | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [NASA POWER D-103 JSON](CLAIMBOUND-NASA-POWER-D103-2026-04-29.json) / [SVG](CLAIMBOUND-NASA-POWER-D103-2026-04-29.svg) | `PASSED_UNDER_PROTOCOL` | NASA POWER |
| [NOAA CO-OPS D-131 JSON](CLAIMBOUND-NOAA-COOPS-D131-2026-04-30.json) / [SVG](CLAIMBOUND-NOAA-COOPS-D131-2026-04-30.svg) | `NEGATIVE_RESULT_UNDER_PROTOCOL` | NOAA CO-OPS |

## Visual Template

The visual share-card template is stored at
[docs/assets/claimbound_evidence_card.svg](../assets/claimbound_evidence_card.svg).

The SVG contains placeholder fields such as `{{record_id}}`,
`{{status_exact}}` and `{{allowed_claim_sentence}}`. A rendered card should be
filled from a validated JSON evidence card, not edited by hand after the result
is known.

To share a result, use either the JSON URL for machine-readable evidence or the
SVG URL for a human-readable card preview.

## Registry

The public registry index is
[docs/registry/evidence_index.json](../registry/evidence_index.json).

The registry is intended to remain freely readable. It stores card metadata and
aggregate statistics, not raw payloads.
