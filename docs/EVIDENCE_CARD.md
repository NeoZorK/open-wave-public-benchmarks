# ClaimBound Evidence Card

A ClaimBound evidence card is the public unit of record for one narrow result.

It should be small enough to read, strict enough to validate, and complete
enough for another operator to decide whether rerunning the protocol is
possible.

## Required Fields

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `evidence_id` | Stable ID for this evidence record. |
| `protocol_id` | ID of the frozen protocol. |
| `protocol_version` | Version or commit-bound protocol reference. |
| `domain` | Public domain under test, such as energy or air quality. |
| `claim_type` | Type of claim: forecast, signal, source audit, reproduction or blocked-source record. |
| `execution_mode` | Required provenance mode: `MANUAL_NO_AI`, `MANUAL_AI_ASSISTED`, `AUTOMATED_NO_AI`, `AUTOMATED_AI_ASSISTED` or `HYBRID_AI_ASSISTED`. |
| `result_status` | Exact status from `docs/RESULT_STATUS.md`. |
| `claim_boundary` | Plain-language limit on what the result does and does not show. |
| `official_source_name` | Human-readable source name. |
| `official_source_url` | URL for the official source or source documentation. |
| `access_date` | Date the source was accessed. |
| `source_rights_note` | Short note on rights, attribution and redistribution boundary. |
| `raw_payload_committed` | Must be `false` unless rights and repository policy explicitly allow it. |
| `raw_payload_manifest` | External hash manifest path, hash value or explanation when blocked. |
| `sanitized_report_path` | Public sanitized report or summary artifact. |
| `sanitized_report_sha256` | SHA-256 for the sanitized report. |
| `git_commit` | Commit containing the protocol and public evidence record. |
| `runner_command` | Exact command or manual-track reference used for the run. |
| `operator` | Person, organization or role that performed the run. |
| `created_at` | Date the evidence card was created. |
| `reproduction_level` | Exact reproduction level from `docs/CLAIMS.md` when applicable. |
| `ai_assistance` | Whether AI assisted with code, protocol drafting, summarization or validation. |
| `manual_review` | Whether a human operator reviewed source rights, protocol boundary and final claim. |
| `known_limitations` | Important limitations and reasons not to overclaim. |

## Forecast-Specific Fields

Forecast evidence cards must also include:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `forecast_question` | Exact question fixed before resolution. |
| `answer_timestamp` | When the model or method answer was recorded. |
| `forecast_deadline` | Last time the forecast could be made. |
| `resolution_deadline` | When the outcome should be resolvable. |
| `model_or_method` | System, model or fixed signal used. |
| `prompt_hash` | Hash of the prompt or input template, when an LLM is used. |
| `resolution_rule` | Exact rule for deciding the outcome. |
| `allowed_resolution_sources` | Official sources accepted for resolution. |
| `scoring_rule` | Pre-selected scoring rule. |

## Execution Modes

Use one exact mode:

| Mode | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `MANUAL_NO_AI` | Human operator performed the track without AI assistance. |
| `MANUAL_AI_ASSISTED` | Human operator performed the track and used AI only within `docs/AI_OPERATOR_PROTOCOL.md`. |
| `AUTOMATED_NO_AI` | Deterministic automation performed the run without AI assistance. |
| `AUTOMATED_AI_ASSISTED` | Automation used AI assistance, but deterministic validation produced the status. |
| `HYBRID_AI_ASSISTED` | Manual and automated steps were combined, with AI assistance disclosed. |

The execution mode is provenance metadata. It does not make a result more or
less valid by itself. A result is valid only when the protocol, source boundary,
hashes, status and claim boundary validate.

## Required Interpretation

The card must make the allowed claim and forbidden claims clear.

Allowed:

```text
This protocol-bound record has status X under source Y, period Z and gate G.
```

Forbidden:

```text
This proves broad model superiority.
This proves deployment readiness.
This proves the raw source bytes will never drift.
This proves correctness outside the protocol boundary.
```

## Example

Current committed examples:

- [NASA POWER D-103 passed evidence card](evidence_cards/CLAIMBOUND-NASA-POWER-D103-2026-04-29.json)
  and [visual SVG](evidence_cards/CLAIMBOUND-NASA-POWER-D103-2026-04-29.svg)
- [NOAA CO-OPS D-131 negative evidence card](evidence_cards/CLAIMBOUND-NOAA-COOPS-D131-2026-04-30.json)

The visual share-card template is

It contains placeholder fields and should be filled from validated card JSON.

## Validation Rules

Evidence cards should fail validation when:

- `execution_mode` is missing or outside the allowed modes;
- `result_status` is not one of the documented statuses;
- `claim_boundary` is missing;
- `raw_payload_committed` is `true`;
- a forecast card lacks a resolution rule;
- a positive record has no baseline or control summary;
- a blocked record does not explain the block reason;
- a reproduction record does not state the reproduction level;
- AI assistance is not disclosed;
- the card contains broad claims outside the protocol boundary.

Run the local validator:

```bash
uv run python scripts/claimbound_validate_evidence_card.py path/to/evidence_card.json
```

The validator is deterministic. It does not try to infer hidden AI use from
writing style. It requires explicit provenance fields and rejects incomplete or
overbroad records.

## Sharing And Registry

To share a result, link directly to its JSON evidence card in
`docs/evidence_cards/`. A visual card can be rendered from the same data by
filling the SVG template fields.

The public registry index is stored in `docs/registry/evidence_index.json`.
It is intended to remain freely readable and to expose aggregate counts by
status, domain and source. The registry stores card metadata and sanitized
report references, not raw payloads.
